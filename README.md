## Usage
- This project was built with Processing 2.2.1 and can be dowloaded here: [Processing](https://processing.org/)
- Load Concert.pde and run

## Notes
- To reduce the size of this project the only event with high quality audio is the TAUK show. All of the other three concerts have highly compressed audio in order to preserve the interactive nature of the project.
